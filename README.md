# Hotel-Room-Booking-System
This python application served as a hotel room booking 
system for several fictional hotel chains. PostgreSQL was used for 
database support. The .txt files are used to populate the database in 
order to demonstrate the features and test the functionality


Customers can use the customer application to login or 
register accounts on the database, from which they can use to search for
 and book hotel rooms if they are available on those dates and no one 
else is occupying them. Employees can use their application to search 
for hotel rooms in the hotel they work in, and can rent directly to 
customers who show up without a booking. The admin application is simply
 a terminal for running SQL queries directly on the database


Note that this was built for a school project and the 
database has since been removed after grading as it was hosted by the 
school on their servers. As such the project no longer works.
